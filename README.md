## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
### 1. Installing & Importing Libraries
Set up the environment by installing and importing key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

```python
# install numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### 2. Loading & Understanding the Dataset
Imported the CSV file and reviewed basic structure, column names, and sample records to understand the data content.

```python
# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory
```

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Students education and career sucess.csv")

# Display first few rows
display(df.head())
```

![Display data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfddde34-a630-4880-90f6-c1b867a2a979)

### 3. Dataset Dimensions
Checked the number of rows and columns, and listed all column names along with their data types.

```python
rows,columns = df.shape
shp = pd.DataFrame({"": ["Rows", "Columns"], "Count": [rows, columns]})
shp.set_index("", inplace=True)
shp
```

### 4. Columns List and Datatypes
Knowing the data types early on is essential for selecting the right transformations, visualizations, and models later in the workflow.

```python
cols = pd.DataFrame({"Columns": df.columns})
cols = cols.reset_index(drop=True)
cols
```

```python
df_summary = pd.DataFrame({
    "Column Name": df.columns,
    "Non-Null Count": df.count().values,  # Count of non-null values
    "Data Type": df.dtypes.values
})

df_summary
```

### 5.üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Verified and handled missing values, formatted columns, and prepared data for analysis using encoding techniques.

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

### 6. Replacing Missing values
Missing value analysis confirms the dataset is clean.


### 7. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics and data visualizations offered deeper insights into the dataset.
- Key summary metrics-such as mean, median, and standard deviation-were used to understand central tendencies and variability.
- Additionally, visual tools like histograms, countplots, boxplots, and pairplots were employed to explore data distributions, identify outliers, and analyze relationships between variables.

```python
## Data visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(11,6))
sns.histplot(df['Starting_Salary'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Starting Salaries")
plt.show()
```

### üìà **Statistical information of Numerical Columns using Heat map**
Measures such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and quartiles were computed to understand the central tendency and spread of each variable.

```python
df.describe()
```
![Statistical info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1a0fbaf-1c8e-4284-b466-fbd0d78617b4)

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6))
sns.heatmap(df.describe().T, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Statistical Summary of Numerical Columns")
plt.show()
```

### üîç **Exploring Feature Relationships Using Pairplot**
- Pairplots were used to visually examine the relationships between multiple numerical features in the dataset.
- These plots display pairwise scatter plots alongside histograms, helping identify trends, clusters, and potential correlations.

```python
sns.pairplot(df[['University_GPA', 'Projects_Completed', 'Internships_Completed','Certifications', 'Job_Offers']])
plt.show()
```

### üìö **Distribution of Field of Study**
- The distribution of the Field of Study variable highlights the number of students pursuing each academic discipline.
- Visualizing this distribution helps identify the most and least popular fields, providing insight into student preferences and academic trends.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(11,6))
sns.countplot(x=df['Field_of_Study'])
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Distribution of Fields of Study")
plt.show()
```

### üì¶ Boxplot to check for outliers
- Boxplots were used to identify outliers and understand the spread of numerical features such as GPA, Starting Salary and internship.
- These plots display the median, quartiles, and potential outliers beyond the whiskers, making it easy to detect unusually high or low values. Identifying outliers is crucial for ensuring data quality and making informed decisions about further preprocessing.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df[['University_GPA', 'Starting_Salary', 'Internships_Completed']])
plt.title("Boxplot of Key Numerical Features")
plt.show()
```

### üíº Bar Plot : Average Starting Salary by Field of Study
This bar plot visualizes the average starting salary across different fields of study. By grouping and averaging salary data, it highlights which academic disciplines tend to lead to higher initial earnings. This comparison provides valuable insights for students and educators in understanding how educational choices can impact early career outcomes.

```python
field_salary = df.groupby("Field_of_Study")["Starting_Salary"].mean().sort_values()

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
barplot = sns.barplot(
    x=field_salary.values,
    y=field_salary.index,
    hue=field_salary.index,
    palette="viridis",
    legend=False
)

# Add salary values on each bar
for i, value in enumerate(field_salary.values):
    plt.text(value + 100, i, f"${value:,.0f}", va='center')  # Adjust position and format

plt.title("Average Starting Salary by Field of Study")
plt.xlabel("Average Salary")
plt.ylabel("Field of Study")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
